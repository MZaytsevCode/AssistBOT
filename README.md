# AssistBOT 
### Simple and convenient bot discord for python.
The source code of the bot, which was made a couple of months ago, and from January 22 to January 23, was redesigned.
This is free open source software and if anyone wants to change things forward. Just before using my code, please unsubscribe to me on Twitter:

 I will be pleased to know that someone uses my work)
 
 #### PS: What do you think, should I make a website for the bot, if so, write to me on Twitter (Link above), and if you want, suggest what to add to me.
